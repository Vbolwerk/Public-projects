# Public-projects
Public projects I have worked on, as part of my learning experience.

### The outline of my projects:
*Billboard EDA:*
- Data entry and transformation in Pandas using a csv-file.
- Visualization in Tableau.

*Identifying good movies from IMDB:*
- Extracting movie ratings and other attributes from the IMDB API using a random id generator.
- Visualizations in Matplotlib.
- Using sklearn countvectorizer for extracting text features from the outline.
- Using decision trees to see if outline or feature length has predictive power over a movie's rating.

*Unsupervised learning on airports:*
- Extracting data from a SQL database.
- Visualizations using matplotlib/ seaborn.
- Dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis.
- 3D-plot of results.
