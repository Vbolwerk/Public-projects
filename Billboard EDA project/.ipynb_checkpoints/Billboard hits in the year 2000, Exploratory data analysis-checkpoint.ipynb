    "The data consists of 317 songs (all in the year 2000) and their evolution in the Billboard charts. For each song the data includes the artist, the length of the song, the genre, the date it entered the charts and the date of the peak in the charts. After this, each song has a timeline of their evolution in the charts. This timeline goes on for 76 weeks, which means that songs that have not been in the charts for 76 weeks has missing data in one of these columns. An interesting next step would be to find out for how many songs this is the case."

Tableau is a nice tool to add to my toolkit for quick and dirty exploratory data analysis in the future, but the downside of Tableau seems to be that it is not always customizable (for example, rotating the label on the y-axis seemed to be impossible).
